# Feature: Intelligent Seed Generation

**Created**: 2025-09-16
**Estimated Start**: 2025-09-16
**Priority**: Medium
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (September 16, 2025)

## üìä **Implementation Results**

- **Generated Data**: 1,220 transactions + 90 transfers (with accounting fixes)
- **Avatar**: Young Professional persona
- **Date Range**: July 1, 2024 to September 16, 2025 (today)
- **Database**: Local PostgreSQL (`fintrack_dev`)
- **Usage**: `npm run seed:generate`
- **Documentation**: [Usage Guide](./USAGE_GUIDE.md)

### **üîß Accounting Fixes Applied** (September 16, 2025)
- ‚úÖ **Math.abs() Corrections**: Removed from calculations, proper signed arithmetic
- ‚úÖ **Transfer Categories**: Emergency Fund, Roth IRA, Credit Card Payment (not "System Transfer")
- ‚úÖ **Amount Preservation**: Database values maintain proper signs throughout
- ‚úÖ **Accounting Integrity**: All transfers net to $0.00, paired transactions verified

## üéØ **Goal**
Replace static seed data with an intelligent, configurable system that generates realistic financial data based on user-specified parameters. This solves the problem of having outdated, unrealistic demo data and provides developers with flexible testing scenarios.

## üë• **User Impact**
Developers and testers can generate realistic financial scenarios for testing, demos, and development. Users will see more believable demo data that reflects real-world financial patterns.

**User Story**: As a developer, I want to generate realistic financial data with configurable date ranges and categories so that I can test different scenarios and create compelling demos.

## üìä **Scope Definition**

### **‚úÖ Must Have (Core Functionality)** - ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [x] JSON configuration file (seed-config.json) with date range and category selection
- [x] Avatar/persona system with 1 predefined user type (young-professional) - expandable
- [x] Realistic transaction description and amount generation based on avatar and category type
- [x] Transfer transactions between accounts (2 linked transactions per transfer)
- [x] Configurable account types and initial balances via JSON config
- [x] User/tenant creation with proper multi-tenant isolation
- [x] Integration with existing Prisma schema and seed system

### **‚ö° Should Have (Important)** - ‚úÖ **PARTIALLY COMPLETED**
- [x] Realistic spending frequency patterns (daily coffee vs monthly rent)
- [ ] Seasonal spending adjustments (holidays, summer vacation)
- [x] Recurring transaction generation (salary, bills, subscriptions)
- [ ] Account balance reconciliation over time
- [ ] CLI parameter support (--config=path/to/config.json)

### **üí° Nice to Have (If Time Permits)**
- [ ] Credit card payment automation between accounts
- [ ] Goal-based spending patterns (saving for vacation, etc.)
- [ ] Export generated data to CSV for analysis
- [ ] Additional avatar types (entrepreneur, single-parent, etc.)
- [ ] Performance optimization for large date ranges

### **‚ùå Out of Scope (For This Version)**

---

## üîó **Dependencies**

### **Prerequisites (Must be done first)**
- [x] Existing Prisma schema with multi-tenant support - Already implemented
- [x] Default categories system (docs/reference/default-categories.ts) - Already exists
- [x] Date utilities (src/lib/utils/date-utils.ts) - Already implemented
- [ ] None - This is a standalone development tool

### **Dependent Features (Blocked by this)**
- Better demo experiences - Will have more realistic data for showcasing
- Performance testing - Will enable testing with larger, realistic datasets
- User onboarding - Can provide better initial experience with realistic data

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Approach**

### **Database Changes**
- [ ] No new tables required - Uses existing schema
- [ ] No schema updates needed - Works with current structure
- [ ] Migration required: No - Pure data generation tool

### **API Endpoints Needed**
- [ ] No API endpoints required - This is a CLI/script tool
- [ ] Uses existing Prisma client for database operations

### **UI Components**
- [ ] No UI components - CLI-based tool
- [ ] Future: Could add web interface for configuration

### **Third-party Integrations**
- Existing Prisma Client - Database operations
- Existing date-utils - Date manipulation and UTC handling
- bcrypt - Password hashing for generated users (already in use)

### **Configuration System Design**

#### **JSON Configuration File Structure**
The system will use a `seed-config.json` file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "dateRange": {
    "startDate": "2024-07-01",
    "endDate": "today"
  },
  "categories": [
    {
      "name": "Salary",
      "type": "INCOME"
    },
    {
      "name": "Food & Dining",
      "type": "EXPENSE"
    },
    {
      "name": "Housing",
      "type": "EXPENSE"
    },
    {
      "name": "Bills & Utilities",
      "type": "EXPENSE"
    },
    {
      "name": "Fun Money",
      "type": "EXPENSE"
    }
  ],
  "accounts": {
    "checking": {
      "name": "Main Checking",
      "initialBalance": 2500,
      "type": "CHECKING"
    },
    "savings": {
      "name": "Emergency Fund",
      "initialBalance": 10000,
      "type": "SAVINGS"
    },
    "credit": {
      "name": "Credit Card",
      "initialBalance": -500,
      "type": "CREDIT"
    }
  },
  "patterns": {
    "transactionFrequency": "realistic",
    "seasonalAdjustments": true,
    "recurringTransactions": true
  },
  "transfers": {
    "enabled": true,
    "types": [
      {
        "name": "Credit Card Payment",
        "fromAccount": "checking",
        "toAccount": "credit",
        "frequency": "monthly",
        "amount": "variable"
      },
      {
        "name": "Emergency Fund Contribution",
        "fromAccount": "checking",
        "toAccount": "savings",
        "frequency": "monthly",
        "amount": 500
      }
    ]
  },
  "user": {
    "email": "demo@fintrack.com",
    "name": "Demo User",
    "tenantName": "Demo Household",
    "avatar": "young-professional"
  }
}
```

#### **Avatar/Persona System**
The `avatar` field determines spending patterns, income levels, and financial behaviors:

**Available Avatars:**
- **`young-professional`**: Recent graduate, $60-80k salary, urban lifestyle, tech-savvy spending
- **`family-household`**: Dual income family, $80-120k combined, child expenses, suburban lifestyle
- **`college-student`**: Part-time income, $15-25k, budget-conscious, irregular spending
- **`retiree`**: Fixed income, $40-60k, healthcare focus, conservative spending
- **`freelancer`**: Variable income, $35-70k, irregular payments, business expenses
- **`high-earner`**: Professional, $120k+, luxury spending, investment focus

**Avatar Influences:**
- **Income patterns**: Salary amounts, frequency, bonuses
- **Spending categories**: Category preferences and amounts
- **Account types**: Appropriate account mix for persona
- **Transfer patterns**: Savings rates, investment contributions
- **Transaction descriptions**: Realistic merchant names and descriptions

**Merchant Variety Examples:**
```javascript
// Food & Dining (20 merchants)
["Whole Foods Market", "Starbucks", "DoorDash", "Chipotle", "Trader Joe's",
 "In-N-Out Burger", "Sweetgreen", "Uber Eats", "McDonald's", "Panera Bread", ...]

// Fun Money (21 merchants)
["Netflix", "Amazon", "Target", "AMC Theaters", "Apple App Store", "Steam",
 "Nordstrom", "Zara", "Local Bar", "Concert Venue", ...]

// Services (12 merchants)
["Uber", "Lyft", "Great Clips", "Car Wash", "Auto Repair Shop", "DMV Fees", ...]
```

**Benefits:**
- **Natural Variety**: Random merchant selection creates realistic spending patterns
- **No Fixed Budgets**: Flexible amounts based on merchant type and avatar behavior
- **Realistic Names**: Actual brand names and common business types
- **Scalable**: Easy to add more merchants for different avatar types

#### **Intelligent Date System**
The system supports both static dates and intelligent date values:

**Static Dates**: `"2024-07-01"` (ISO format)

**Intelligent Date Values**:
- **`"today"`**: Current date when script runs
- **`"yesterday"`**: One day before current date
- **Relative Dates**:
  - `"-30days"`: 30 days ago from today
  - `"-6months"`: 6 months ago from today
  - `"-1year"`: 1 year ago from today
  - `"+7days"`: 7 days from today (future dates)

**Examples**:
```json
{
  "dateRange": {
    "startDate": "-6months",  // 6 months ago
    "endDate": "today"        // Up to current date
  }
}

{
  "dateRange": {
    "startDate": "2024-01-01", // Fixed start date
    "endDate": "today"         // Dynamic end date
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- **Always Current**: Seed data stays up-to-date automatically
- **Flexible Testing**: Easy to generate data for different time periods
- **Demo Ready**: Perfect for live demos with current data

#### **Configuration Defaults**
- **Default config location**: `prisma/seed-config.json`
- **Fallback behavior**: If no config file exists, use current hardcoded defaults
- **Validation**: Schema validation for required fields and data types
- **Date Resolution**: Intelligent dates resolved at runtime using UTC

#### **Usage**
```bash
# Use default config (prisma/seed-config.json)
npm run seed:generate

# Use custom config location (Should Have feature)
npm run seed:generate --config=custom-config.json
```

#### **Transfer Transaction Implementation**
Transfer transactions will be implemented as **paired transactions** to maintain double-entry accounting principles:

**Example: Credit Card Payment ($300)**
```javascript
// Transaction 1: Debit from checking account
{
  account_id: checkingAccount.id,
  category_id: creditCardPaymentCategory.id,
  amount: -300.00,
  description: "Credit Card Payment",
  type: "TRANSFER",
  transfer_pair_id: "unique-transfer-id"
}

// Transaction 2: Credit to credit card account
{
  account_id: creditCardAccount.id,
  category_id: creditCardPaymentCategory.id,
  amount: 300.00,
  description: "Credit Card Payment",
  type: "TRANSFER",
  transfer_pair_id: "unique-transfer-id"
}
```

**Transfer Types Supported:**
- **Fixed Amount**: Exact amount specified in config (e.g., $500 monthly savings)
- **Variable Amount**: Calculated based on account balances or spending patterns
- **Percentage**: Percentage of account balance or income
- **Frequency**: Daily, weekly, monthly, or custom intervals

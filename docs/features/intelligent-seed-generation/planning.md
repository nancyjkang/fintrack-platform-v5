# Feature: Intelligent Seed Generation

**Created**: 2025-09-16
**Estimated Start**: 2025-09-16
**Priority**: Medium

---

## üéØ **Goal**
Replace static seed data with an intelligent, configurable system that generates realistic financial data based on user-specified parameters. This solves the problem of having outdated, unrealistic demo data and provides developers with flexible testing scenarios.

## üë• **User Impact**
Developers and testers can generate realistic financial scenarios for testing, demos, and development. Users will see more believable demo data that reflects real-world financial patterns.

**User Story**: As a developer, I want to generate realistic financial data with configurable date ranges and categories so that I can test different scenarios and create compelling demos.

## üìä **Scope Definition**

### **‚úÖ Must Have (Core Functionality)**
- [ ] CLI script that accepts input config with date range parameters (start-date, end-date) and categories
- [ ] Realistic transaction description and amount generation based on category type
- [ ] Configurable account types and initial balances
- [ ] User/tenant creation with proper multi-tenant isolation
- [ ] Integration with existing Prisma schema and seed system

### **‚ö° Should Have (Important)**
- [ ] Realistic spending frequency patterns (daily coffee vs monthly rent)
- [ ] Seasonal spending adjustments (holidays, summer vacation)
- [ ] Recurring transaction generation (salary, bills, subscriptions)
- [ ] Account balance reconciliation over time
- [ ] Configuration file support (JSON configs)

### **üí° Nice to Have (If Time Permits)**
- [ ] Credit card payment automation between accounts
- [ ] Goal-based spending patterns (saving for vacation, etc.)
- [ ] Export generated data to CSV for analysis
- [ ] Multiple user profiles (student, family, retiree patterns)
- [ ] Performance optimization for large date ranges

### **‚ùå Out of Scope (For This Version)**
- AI/ML-powered pattern generation (too complex for v1)
- Real bank data import simulation (separate feature)
- Advanced investment account modeling (focus on basic accounts)
- Multi-currency support (USD only for now)

---

## üîó **Dependencies**

### **Prerequisites (Must be done first)**
- [x] Existing Prisma schema with multi-tenant support - Already implemented
- [x] Default categories system (docs/reference/default-categories.ts) - Already exists
- [x] Date utilities (src/lib/utils/date-utils.ts) - Already implemented
- [ ] None - This is a standalone development tool

### **Dependent Features (Blocked by this)**
- Better demo experiences - Will have more realistic data for showcasing
- Performance testing - Will enable testing with larger, realistic datasets
- User onboarding - Can provide better initial experience with realistic data

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Approach**

### **Database Changes**
- [ ] No new tables required - Uses existing schema
- [ ] No schema updates needed - Works with current structure
- [ ] Migration required: No - Pure data generation tool

### **API Endpoints Needed**
- [ ] No API endpoints required - This is a CLI/script tool
- [ ] Uses existing Prisma client for database operations

### **UI Components**
- [ ] No UI components - CLI-based tool
- [ ] Future: Could add web interface for configuration

### **Third-party Integrations**
- Commander.js - CLI argument parsing and command structure
- Existing Prisma Client - Database operations
- Existing date-utils - Date manipulation and UTC handling
- bcrypt - Password hashing for generated users (already in use)

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è **Estimates**

### **Complexity Assessment**
- **Overall Complexity**: Medium
- **Core Script Development**: 4 hours - CLI setup, basic pattern generation
- **Pattern Intelligence**: 6 hours - Realistic amounts, frequencies, seasonal adjustments
- **Configuration System**: 3 hours - JSON configs, CLI argument parsing
- **Testing & Polish**: 3 hours - Edge cases, documentation, examples

### **Time Estimate**
- **Total Estimate**: 2 days (16 hours)
- **Buffer (20%)**: 0.4 days (3 hours)
- **Final Estimate**: 2.5 days

### **Risk Assessment**
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Main Risks**:
  - Pattern complexity: Could get too detailed and slow development - Mitigation: Start simple, iterate
  - Performance with large date ranges: Could be slow - Mitigation: Batch operations, progress tracking

---

## ‚úÖ **Success Criteria**

### **Functional Requirements**
- [ ] CLI accepts --start-date and --end-date parameters
- [ ] CLI accepts --categories parameter to filter which categories to use
- [ ] Generates realistic transaction amounts appropriate for each category type
- [ ] Creates proper user/tenant/membership relationships
- [ ] Maintains account balance integrity over the date range
- [ ] Supports configuration files for complex scenarios

### **Performance Requirements**
- [ ] Generates 6 months of data in < 30 seconds
- [ ] Handles date ranges up to 2 years without memory issues
- [ ] Shows progress for operations taking > 5 seconds

### **Quality Requirements**
- [ ] All generated data passes Prisma validation
- [ ] No TypeScript errors in the script
- [ ] Comprehensive CLI help and examples
- [ ] Error handling for invalid date ranges and missing categories

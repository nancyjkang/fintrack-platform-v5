## 🔧 **Technical Decisions**

### **Data Cube Architecture**
- **Decision**: Use dimensional modeling with pre-aggregated facts
- **Rationale**: Provides flexible querying with excellent performance for analytics
- **Impact**: Sub-second query response times for complex multi-dimensional analysis

### **Database Design**
- **Decision**: Denormalize category and account names in cube for performance
- **Rationale**: Avoids expensive JOINs in analytical queries
- **Impact**: Faster queries at the cost of slightly increased storage

### **Real-time Updates**
- **Decision**: Use database triggers for automatic cube updates
- **Rationale**: Ensures data consistency without application complexity
- **Impact**: Cube stays synchronized with transaction changes automatically

### **Frontend Visualization**
- **Decision**: Use Recharts library for data visualization
- **Rationale**: Consistent with existing v5 architecture and proven performance
- **Impact**: Rich, interactive charts with good mobile support

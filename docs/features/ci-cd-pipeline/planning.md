# CI/CD Pipeline with Database Migrations - Planning Document

**Feature ID**: `ci-cd-pipeline`
**Priority**: High (Infrastructure)
**Complexity**: High
**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed
**Estimated Effort**: 1 day
**Actual Effort**: 1 day

---

## üìã **Feature Overview**

### **Business Problem**
Manual deployments are error-prone, time-consuming, and risky, especially when database migrations are involved. Without automated CI/CD:
- Deployments require manual coordination of code and database changes
- Risk of human error during deployment process
- No automated testing before production deployment
- Difficult to rollback failed deployments
- Inconsistent deployment processes across environments

### **Solution Summary**
Implement a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions that automatically handles:
- Code quality validation (linting, type checking, testing)
- Security auditing and vulnerability scanning
- Database migration testing and deployment
- Automated staging deployments
- Controlled production deployments with manual approval
- Health checks and rollback capabilities

### **Success Criteria**
- ‚úÖ Every commit to main triggers automated CI/CD pipeline
- ‚úÖ Database migrations are safely applied during deployment
- ‚úÖ Zero-downtime deployments to staging and production
- ‚úÖ Automatic rollback on deployment failure
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive health checks after deployment
- ‚úÖ Manual approval gate for production deployments

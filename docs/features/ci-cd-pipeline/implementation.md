```yaml
Pipeline Stages:
├── Continuous Integration
│   ├── Code checkout and Node.js setup
│   ├── Dependency installation and Prisma generation
│   ├── Linting (ESLint) and type checking (TypeScript)
│   ├── Test suite execution with coverage reporting
│   └── Application build validation
├── Security Audit
│   ├── npm audit for vulnerability scanning
│   └── High-severity vulnerability blocking
├── Database Migration Testing
│   ├── Fresh PostgreSQL database setup
│   ├── Migration execution from scratch
│   ├── Database seeding validation
│   └── Schema integrity verification
├── Staging Deployment
│   ├── Database migration on staging environment
│   ├── Vercel deployment to staging
│   ├── Health check validation
│   └── PR comment with deployment URL
└── Production Deployment (Manual Approval)
    ├── Production database backup
    ├── Database migration on production
    ├── Vercel deployment to production
    ├── Comprehensive health checks
    └── Success/failure notifications
```

### **Deployment Scripts Architecture**
```bash
scripts/
├── deploy-with-migrations.sh    # Complete deployment with DB migrations
├── safe-migrate.sh             # Safe database migration with backup/rollback
└── Enhanced npm scripts         # Convenient deployment commands
```

### **Safety Mechanisms**
- **Database Backups**: Automatic compressed backups before every production migration
- **Dry Run Capability**: Preview migrations without applying changes
- **Health Checks**: Multi-stage validation after deployment
- **Rollback Systems**: Both automatic (on failure) and manual rollback options
- **Manual Approval**: Production deployments require explicit human approval

## 🎯 **Solo Developer Workflow Best Practices**

### **Main Branch Development Strategy**
Since FinTrack v5 is developed by a single developer, we can optimize the workflow:

#### **✅ Benefits of Direct Main Development**
- **No merge conflicts** - Single developer means no competing changes
- **Faster iteration** - No branch switching overhead
- **Simpler workflow** - Less git complexity
- **Immediate feedback** - See results right away

#### **🛡️ Safety Measures for Solo Development**
- **Pre-commit validation** - Every commit tested before it goes in
- **Automatic rollback capability** - Easy to revert if something breaks
- **Comprehensive pre-push hooks** - Catch issues before CI/CD
- **Production deployment gates** - Manual approval for critical changes

#### **🚨 The One Rule: Never Break Main**
- Main branch must **always** be deployable
- If a commit breaks something, **immediate rollback**
- No "work in progress" commits - only complete, working features

### **Git Hook Strategy Implementation**

#### **Pre-Commit Hooks (Fast - < 10 seconds)**
```bash
# Implemented in .husky/pre-commit
- ✅ CSS syntax validation
- ✅ TypeScript compilation check
- ✅ Test suite execution
- ✅ Basic code quality validation
```

#### **Pre-Push Hooks (Comprehensive - 30-60 seconds)**
```bash
# Implemented in .husky/pre-push
- 🔍 Production build verification
- 🔍 TypeScript type checking
- 🔍 ESLint code quality (when enabled)
- 🔍 Full test suite execution
- 🔍 Security audit (npm audit)
```

This **two-tier approach** ensures:
- **Fast commits** - developers aren't slowed down by heavy validation
- **Safe pushes** - comprehensive validation before sharing code
- **Deployable main** - every push is production-ready

### **Atomic Commit Strategy**
```bash
# ✅ GOOD: Single feature, single commit
git add src/components/transactions/TransactionForm.tsx
git commit -m "feat: add transaction date validation

- Implement date range validation for transactions
- Add user-friendly error messages
- Include edge case handling for future dates
- Files: TransactionForm.tsx"

# ❌ BAD: Multiple features in one commit
git add . && git commit -m "fix everything"
```

---

## 🚀 **Production Deployment & Rollback Procedures**

### **Deployment Architecture**
FinTrack v5 uses a **hybrid deployment model**:
- **Frontend**: Static files deployed to Vercel
- **Database**: PostgreSQL hosted on Supabase
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automation

### **Rollback Scenarios & Solutions**

#### **Scenario 1: Bad Code Deploy (Broken UI/Logic)**
```bash
# Quick rollback via Vercel
vercel rollback  # Built-in Vercel rollback to previous deployment

# Or manual git rollback
git checkout main
git reset --hard <last-known-good-commit>
git push --force-with-lease origin main  # Triggers new deployment
```

#### **Scenario 2: Database Migration Issues**
```bash
# Manual database rollback via Supabase SQL Editor
# 1. Connect to Supabase dashboard
# 2. Navigate to SQL Editor
# 3. Execute rollback script from docs/releases/v5.0.0/
# 4. Verify data integrity

# Code rollback to previous schema version
git checkout main
git reset --hard <pre-migration-commit>
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

#### **Scenario 3: Critical Production Bug**
```bash
# Emergency rollback procedure
# 1. Immediate Vercel rollback
vercel rollback

# 2. If database changes involved
# Execute emergency rollback SQL script

# 3. Notify users (if necessary)
# Update status page or send notifications
```

### **Production Safety Measures**

#### **Deployment Checklist**
Before any production deployment:
- [ ] All tests pass locally and in CI
- [ ] Database migrations tested on staging
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] Rollback plan documented and ready
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured

#### **Gradual Rollout Strategy**
```typescript
// Feature flags for safe rollouts
const FEATURE_FLAGS = {
  newTransactionUI: {
    enabled: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',
    rolloutPercentage: 0 // Gradually increase: 0 -> 10 -> 50 -> 100
  }
};

// Progressive enablement
if (FEATURE_FLAGS.newTransactionUI.enabled ||
    Math.random() * 100 < FEATURE_FLAGS.newTransactionUI.rolloutPercentage) {
  return <NewTransactionForm />;
} else {
  return <LegacyTransactionForm />;
}
```

#### **Monitoring & Error Tracking**
```typescript
// Client-side error reporting
window.addEventListener('error', (event) => {
  // Log to monitoring service
  console.error('Production Error:', {
    error: event.error.message,
    stack: event.error.stack,
    version: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  });
});
```

### **Recovery Procedures**

#### **If Deployment Breaks**
```bash
# 1. Immediate assessment
# Check Vercel deployment logs
# Check Supabase database connectivity
# Check application error logs

# 2. Quick rollback
vercel rollback  # Fastest option

# 3. Root cause analysis
git log --oneline -10  # Recent changes
git diff <last-good> <current>  # What changed

# 4. Fix and redeploy
# Create hotfix
# Test thoroughly
# Deploy with extra monitoring
```

#### **If Database Issues Occur**
```bash
# 1. Assess data integrity
# Connect to Supabase SQL Editor
# Run data validation queries

# 2. Rollback if necessary
# Execute rollback SQL from release scripts
# Verify data consistency

# 3. Application rollback
# Revert to compatible application version
# Ensure schema compatibility
```

### **Rollback Decision Matrix**

| Issue Type | Severity | Rollback Strategy | Time to Rollback |
|------------|----------|-------------------|------------------|
| UI Bug | Low | Fix forward | N/A |
| Logic Error | Medium | Vercel rollback | 2 minutes |
| Database Issue | High | DB + App rollback | 5 minutes |
| App Won't Load | Critical | Emergency rollback | 1 minute |

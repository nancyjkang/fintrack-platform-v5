# Feature: Financial Insights Engine

**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Estimated Start**: 2025-10-01 (after trend-cube-analysis)
**Priority**: Medium

---

## üéØ **Goal**
Create an intelligent financial insights engine that automatically analyzes user spending patterns, detects anomalies, and generates personalized recommendations. This transforms FinTrack from a passive tracking tool into an active financial advisor that proactively helps users optimize their finances.

## üë• **User Impact**
Users receive personalized, actionable financial insights without manual analysis:
- **Automatic Detection**: Spending spikes, new merchants, recurring payment changes
- **Proactive Alerts**: Budget variance warnings, unusual activity notifications
- **Optimization Tips**: Subscription consolidation, seasonal spending patterns, cost-saving opportunities
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Based on individual spending patterns and preferences

**User Story**: As a FinTrack user, I want to receive intelligent, personalized financial insights and alerts so that I can make better financial decisions without having to manually analyze my spending data.

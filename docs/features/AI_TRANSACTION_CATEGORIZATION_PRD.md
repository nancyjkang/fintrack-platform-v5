**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** January 2025
**Author:** FinTrack Development Team
**Status:** Draft

---

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the development of an AI-powered transaction categorization and recurring detection system for FinTrack v4. The feature will automatically suggest appropriate categories for user transactions and identify recurring patterns based on existing category patterns, merchant names, amounts, dates, and historical user behavior - all while maintaining our core privacy-first approach with local processing.

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points
- **Manual categorization is time-consuming** - Users spend 2-3 minutes per transaction
- **Inconsistent categorization** - Same merchants get different categories over time
- **High cognitive load** - Users must remember and apply categorization rules
- **Data entry friction** - Poor categorization experience reduces app usage
- **Categorization errors** - Manual mistakes lead to inaccurate financial insights
- **Recurring transaction management** - Users must manually identify and set up recurring patterns
- **Missed recurring opportunities** - Users don't recognize regular expenses that could be automated

### User Impact
- **Time waste**: 30+ minutes per month on categorization and recurring setup
- **Poor data quality**: Inconsistent categories affect reporting accuracy
- **User frustration**: Tedious manual work reduces engagement
- **Abandonment risk**: Users may stop using the app due to categorization burden
- **Missed automation**: Users don't benefit from recurring transaction features
- **Incomplete financial picture**: Missing recurring patterns affect budgeting accuracy

## Solution Overview

### Core Concept
An intelligent categorization and recurring detection system that:
- **Analyzes transaction patterns** using local AI processing
- **Suggests appropriate categories** with confidence scores
- **Identifies recurring transaction patterns** automatically
- **Learns from user corrections** to improve accuracy over time
- **Maintains complete privacy** with no external data transmission
- **Reduces categorization time** by 90% while improving accuracy
- **Automates recurring transaction setup** to save additional time

### Key Features

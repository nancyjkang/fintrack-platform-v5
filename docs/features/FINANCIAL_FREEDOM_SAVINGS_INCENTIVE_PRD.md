# Financial Freedom & Savings Incentive System PRD
## FinTrack v4 - Privacy-First Personal Finance App

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** January 2025
**Author:** FinTrack Development Team
**Status:** Draft

---

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the development of a comprehensive Financial Freedom & Savings Incentive System for FinTrack v4. The feature will help users visualize their path to financial independence, track savings progress, set and achieve financial goals, and predict when they will become financially free based on their net worth, savings rate, and age - all while maintaining our core privacy-first approach with local-only processing.

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points
- **No long-term perspective** - Users can't see the impact of their financial decisions
- **Lack of motivation** - No clear connection between daily choices and financial goals
- **Unclear path to freedom** - Users don't know when they can achieve financial independence
- **No goal tracking** - Limited ability to set and track financial milestones
- **Poor savings habits** - No incentive or visualization for saving money
- **Retirement uncertainty** - Users don't know if they're on track for retirement
- **Decision paralysis** - No guidance on spending vs. saving trade-offs

### User Impact

## Technical Requirements

### TR1.1: Savings Aggregation Structure

Define the `SavingsAgg` interface and implementation requirements:

```typescript
interface SavingsAgg {
  period: string;                    // YYYY-MM-DD format (start date of period)
  startDate: string;                 // YYYY-MM-DD format (explicit start date)
  endDate: string;                   // YYYY-MM-DD format (explicit end date)
  periodType: SavingsPeriodType;     // weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, quarterly, bi-annually, annually
  totalIncome: number;               // Sum of all income transactions in period
  totalExpenses: number;             // Sum of all expense transactions in period
  netSavings: number;                // totalIncome - totalExpenses
  savingsRate: number;               // netSavings / totalIncome (0-1 range)
  metadata: SavingsAggMetadata;      // Data quality and calculation info
}
```

**Unique Key:** `period + periodType` (composite key)
- Ensures uniqueness across different period types
- Example: "2024-01-01" + "weekly" vs "2024-01-01" + "monthly"

**Requirements:**
- Single-dimension aggregation (period-based only, no category/account breakdown)
- Efficient calculation from transaction data
- Data quality tracking (complete, partial, estimated)
- Support for all standard period types (weekly through annually)
- Persistence in localStorage alongside existing data structures
- **Client-side cumulative calculations**: Cumulative savings calculated on-demand to ensure accuracy and reduce storage

### TR1.2: Proactive Data Regeneration

Implement automatic regeneration of aggregated data when underlying transactions change:

**Current State Analysis:**
- `SpendCube` data exists but is not automatically regenerated when transactions are modified
- `SavingsAgg` needs similar proactive regeneration to maintain data consistency

**Requirements:**
- **Transaction Event Hooks**: Trigger data regeneration when transactions are created, updated, or deleted
- **Incremental Updates**: Update only affected periods rather than full regeneration when possible
- **Batch Processing**: Group multiple transaction changes to minimize regeneration overhead
- **Background Processing**: Perform regeneration asynchronously to avoid blocking UI
- **Data Consistency**: Ensure both `SpendCube` and `SavingsAgg` are updated together when transactions change

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Add event hooks to transaction CRUD operations
2. **Debounced Regeneration**: Use debouncing to batch multiple rapid changes
3. **Affected Period Detection**: Calculate which periods are impacted by transaction changes
4. **Parallel Updates**: Update both `SpendCube` and `SavingsAgg` in parallel for efficiency
5. **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of regeneration failures with retry mechanisms

**Triggering Events:**
- `createTransaction()` - Regenerate period containing new transaction date
- `updateTransaction()` - Regenerate periods containing old and new transaction dates
- `deleteTransaction()` - Regenerate period containing deleted transaction date
- `bulkUpdateTransactions()` - Regenerate all affected periods
- `importTransactionsFromCSV()` - Regenerate all affected periods
- **User Preference Changes**: Regenerate when breakdown period preferences change

The privacy-first approach ensures that users maintain complete control over their financial data while providing powerful planning capabilities that help them achieve their financial goals. This feature will differentiate FinTrack v4 from competitors and position it as a leader in privacy-focused financial planning applications.

The combination of gamification, visualization, and accurate financial calculations will create a compelling user experience that motivates positive financial behavior and helps users achieve financial independence.

# Feature: Account Management

**Created**: 2025-09-15
**Estimated Start**: 2025-09-15
**Priority**: High

---

## üéØ **Goal**
Implement a complete Account Management system for FinTrack v5 that allows users to manage their financial accounts (checking, savings, credit cards, investments, loans) with full CRUD operations, balance reconciliation, and proper visual organization. This feature provides the foundation for transaction management and financial tracking.

## üë• **User Impact**
Users can organize their financial life by managing all their accounts in one place, track balances accurately, reconcile accounts with bank statements, and maintain a clear overview of their financial position across different account types.

**User Story**: As a FinTrack user, I want to manage my financial accounts (create, edit, delete, reconcile) so that I can track my money across different banks and account types with accurate balances.

## üìä **Scope Definition**

### **‚úÖ Must Have (Core Functionality)**
- [x] **Account CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete accounts with proper validation
- [x] **Account Types Support**: Checking, Savings, Credit Card, Investment, Loan, Traditional Retirement, Roth Retirement with appropriate icons and colors

## üóÑÔ∏è **Database Schema Updates**

The Account model needs to be updated to include the new account types and net worth classification:

```prisma
model Account {
  id                  Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  tenant_id           String
  name                String
  type                String   // CHECKING, SAVINGS, CREDIT_CARD, INVESTMENT, LOAN, TRADITIONAL_RETIREMENT, ROTH_RETIREMENT
  net_worth_category  String   // ASSET, LIABILITY, EXCLUDED
  balance             Decimal  @db.Decimal(12, 2)
  balance_date        DateTime
  color               String
  is_active           Boolean  @default(true)
  created_at          DateTime @default(now())
  updated_at          DateTime @updatedAt

  // Relationships
  tenant          Tenant                 @relation(fields: [tenant_id], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  transactions    Transaction[]
  balance_anchors AccountBalanceAnchor[]

  // Unique constraints
  @@unique([tenant_id, name])
  @@map("accounts")
}
```

**Default Net Worth Categories by Account Type**:
- **ASSET**: CHECKING, SAVINGS, INVESTMENT, TRADITIONAL_RETIREMENT, ROTH_RETIREMENT
- **LIABILITY**: CREDIT_CARD, LOAN
- **EXCLUDED**: User can manually set any account type to excluded

**Migration Required**: Add `net_worth_category` column with appropriate defaults based on account type.

---

## üìù **Notes & Decisions**

### **Technical Decisions**
- **UI Framework**: Use existing v5 component patterns with Tailwind CSS for exact v4.1 matching
- **Service Layer**: Use AccountService for all database operations following established patterns
- **Balance Calculation**: Leverage existing [MVP Accounting System](../../architecture/mvp-accounting-system.md) for accurate balance calculations with anchor support
- **State Management**: Use React state with proper lifting for modal management
- **Validation**: Use Zod schemas for both client and server-side validation
- **Reconciliation**: Create adjustment transactions through existing transaction system (Balance Anchor + Initial Transaction pattern)
- **Account Types**: Extended from v4.1's 5 types to 7 types, adding Traditional Retirement and Roth Retirement for better retirement account management
- **Net Worth Tracking**: Add `net_worth_category` field (ASSET | LIABILITY | EXCLUDED) to enable proper net worth calculations

### **Net Worth Tracking - Additional Account Attributes**

For comprehensive net worth tracking, consider adding these account attributes:

#### **Essential for Net Worth Calculation**
1. **`net_worth_category`** (ASSET | LIABILITY | EXCLUDED):
   - **ASSET**: Checking, Savings, Investment, Traditional/Roth Retirement (positive contribution)
   - **LIABILITY**: Credit Cards, Loans (negative contribution)
   - **EXCLUDED**: Accounts that shouldn't count toward net worth (e.g., business accounts)

#### **Future Enhancements (Not in v1)**
2. **`account_number_last4`** (String, optional):
   - Last 4 digits of account number for identification
   - Helps distinguish multiple accounts at same institution
   - Never store full account numbers for security

5. **`interest_rate`** (Decimal, optional):
   - Current interest rate for savings, loans, credit cards
   - Useful for projections and optimization recommendations
   - Can help identify high-interest debt to prioritize

6. **`credit_limit`** (Decimal, optional, for credit accounts):
   - Credit limit for credit cards and lines of credit
   - Enables credit utilization tracking
   - Important for credit score monitoring

#### **Advanced Features**
7. **`maturity_date`** (Date, optional):
   - For CDs, bonds, loans with fixed terms
   - Enables timeline planning and maturity tracking

8. **`minimum_balance`** (Decimal, optional):
   - Required minimum balance to avoid fees
   - Helps with cash flow planning

9. **`monthly_fee`** (Decimal, optional):
   - Monthly maintenance fees
   - Useful for account cost analysis

10. **`notes`** (Text, optional):
    - Free-form notes about the account
    - Account-specific goals, restrictions, or reminders

#### **Net Worth Calculation Logic**
```typescript
const calculateNetWorth = async (accounts: Account[]) => {
  let totalNetWorth = 0;

  for (const account of accounts) {
    if (account.net_worth_category === 'EXCLUDED' || !account.is_active) {
      continue; // Skip excluded or inactive accounts
    }

    // Use existing accounting system for accurate balance calculation
    const currentBalance = await calculateAccountBalance(account.id);

    if (account.net_worth_category === 'ASSET') {
      totalNetWorth += currentBalance; // Add assets
    } else if (account.net_worth_category === 'LIABILITY') {
      totalNetWorth -= Math.abs(currentBalance); // Subtract liabilities
    }
  }

  return totalNetWorth;
};
```

**Note**: This leverages the existing `calculateAccountBalance()` function from our [MVP Accounting System](../../architecture/mvp-accounting-system.md), which handles:
- Balance anchor + transaction calculations
- Bidirectional balance calculation (forward/backward from anchors)
- Graceful fallback to direct transaction sum
- Real-time balance accuracy

### **Implementation Details & Decisions Made**

#### **Account Deletion Logic** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- **Active Accounts**: Always set to `is_active: false` when "deleted" - preserves data and transactions
- **Inactive Accounts**: Can be permanently deleted if no transactions exist
- **User Experience**: Different confirmation messages based on account status
- **API Behavior**: DELETE endpoint returns specific error for accounts with transactions

#### **Form Validation & User Experience** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- **Account Form**: Supports both create and edit modes with proper field handling
- **Balance Fields**: Only editable during account creation, read-only during edit
- **Color Customization**: Custom color picker with hex input, no preset colors
- **Active Status**: Re-added checkbox to allow users to reactivate inactive accounts
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and loading states

#### **UI Architecture Decisions** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- **Component Structure**: Integrated AccountsList and AccountCard into AccountsPageContent for simplicity
- **Tab Navigation**: Active/Inactive filtering with accurate counts
- **v4.1 Compatibility**: Exact layout matching with proper spacing, colors, and typography
- **Responsive Design**: Grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes

#### **API & Service Layer** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- **Filter Handling**: Proper null value handling in query parameters
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for request/response validation
- **Error Responses**: Consistent error format across all endpoints
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests for both service and API layers

### **Open Questions**
- **Balance History**: Should we track balance changes over time? - Decision: Out of scope for v1, use transaction history
- **Net Worth Attributes**: Which additional attributes should be included in v1 vs future phases?

### **Assumptions**
- **Existing Transaction System**: Can handle adjustment transactions - Impact: Core reconciliation feature depends on this
- **User Behavior**: Users will primarily use 3-5 accounts - Impact: UI optimized for small to medium account counts

# Enhanced Recurring Transactions

**Status**: 📋 Ready for Development
**Priority**: Medium-High
**Estimate**: 6 days
**Dependencies**: Transaction CRUD ✅, Category Management ✅

---

## 🎯 **Feature Overview**

Enhanced recurring transaction system that enables users to track frequency patterns, predict future transactions, and manage recurring financial obligations with smart scheduling and variance detection.

### **Key Benefits**
- **Identify** recurring patterns automatically
- **Expect** upcoming transactions with specific frequencies
- **Prepare** for future financial obligations
- **Plan** budgets around predictable schedules
- **Detect** variances and missing transactions

---

## 🔧 **Core Features**

### **Frequency Pattern Management**
- **Multiple Frequencies**: Weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually
- **Custom Patterns**: "Every 3 months", "Every 45 days"
- **Smart Scheduling**: Next expected date calculation
- **Flexible Duration**: Start and end dates for patterns

### **Future Transaction Forecasting**
- **Forecast Periods**: 3, 6, and 12-month projections
- **Calendar View**: Visual timeline of upcoming transactions
- **Cash Flow Projections**: Income and expense predictions
- **Date Intelligence**: Weekend/holiday adjustments

### **Variance Detection & Alerts**
- **Overdue Alerts**: Notifications for late transactions
- **Amount Variance**: Detection of significant amount changes
- **Pattern Changes**: Automatic pattern adjustment suggestions
- **Accuracy Tracking**: Prediction vs. actual performance

### **Template Management**
- **Transaction Templates**: Pre-configured recurring transaction setups
- **Bulk Creation**: Generate multiple recurring patterns
- **Category Integration**: Auto-categorization for recurring items
- **Template Updates**: Modify templates without affecting existing data

## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture**

### **Database Design**
```sql
-- New Tables
recurring_patterns          -- Pattern definitions and schedules
recurring_transaction_history -- Tracking and variance analysis

-- Enhanced Tables
transactions                 -- Added recurring pattern references
```

### **Key Components**
- **RecurringPatternManager**: Pattern CRUD and management
- **ForecastingEngine**: Future transaction prediction
- **VarianceDetector**: Pattern deviation analysis
- **CalendarView**: Visual timeline interface

---

## 📊 **User Experience**

### **Creating Recurring Patterns**
1. Mark existing transaction as recurring OR create new pattern
2. Select frequency (monthly, quarterly, etc.)
3. Set schedule (start date, optional end date)
4. Configure variance thresholds
5. Enable auto-generation if desired

### **Managing Recurring Transactions**
1. View patterns dashboard with status indicators
2. Review upcoming transactions in calendar view
3. Handle variance alerts and overdue items
4. Adjust patterns based on changes
5. View cash flow forecasts for planning

### **Variance Handling**
1. Receive notifications for transaction variances
2. Confirm changes or mark as one-time exceptions
3. Adjust patterns or update thresholds
4. System learns and improves predictions

Users need to track recurring transactions with specific frequency patterns to:
- **Identify** recurring income and expenses automatically
- **Expect** upcoming transactions based on historical patterns
- **Prepare** for future financial obligations and income
- **Plan** budgets around predictable transaction schedules
- **Detect** when expected recurring transactions are missing or delayed

### **Solution Summary**

## üîß **Core Requirements**

### **FR1: Frequency Pattern Management**
**Description**: Track and manage various recurring transaction frequencies

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Support multiple frequency types: Weekly, Bi-weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, Semi-annually, Annually
- Allow custom frequency patterns (e.g., "Every 3 months", "Every 45 days")
- Store next expected date for each recurring transaction
- Handle frequency changes and updates
- Support start and end dates for recurring patterns

**User Stories**:
- As a user, I want to mark my salary as "Monthly" recurring so I can expect it every month
- As a user, I want to set my car insurance as "Semi-annually" so I can prepare for the payment
- As a user, I want to mark quarterly tax payments so I don't forget them

### **FR2: Future Transaction Forecasting**
**Description**: Predict and display upcoming recurring transactions

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Generate forecast of upcoming transactions for next 3, 6, and 12 months
- Show expected dates and amounts for each recurring transaction
- Allow users to view upcoming transactions in calendar format
- Provide cash flow projections based on recurring patterns
- Handle date adjustments for weekends/holidays

**User Stories**:
- As a user, I want to see all my expected transactions for the next 3 months
- As a user, I want to know when my next rent payment is due
- As a user, I want to see my projected cash flow including all recurring items

### **FR3: Variance Detection and Alerts**
**Description**: Detect when recurring transactions deviate from expected patterns

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Alert when expected recurring transaction is overdue
- Detect amount variations in recurring transactions
- Notify when recurring pattern appears to have changed
- Allow users to confirm or adjust recurring patterns
- Track accuracy of recurring transaction predictions

**User Stories**:
- As a user, I want to be notified if my salary is late
- As a user, I want to know if my utility bill amount has changed significantly
- As a user, I want to confirm when a recurring transaction pattern changes

### **FR4: Template Management**
**Description**: Create and manage recurring transaction templates

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Create templates from existing transactions
- Pre-populate transaction details from templates
- Support template categories and descriptions
- Allow template modifications without affecting existing transactions
- Enable bulk creation of recurring transactions from templates

**User Stories**:
- As a user, I want to create a template for my monthly rent payment
- As a user, I want to quickly add a new recurring expense using a template
- As a user, I want to update my salary template when I get a raise

## üèóÔ∏è **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Schema Updates**

#### **Design Philosophy: Simplified Approach**
This implementation uses a **simplified schema** that avoids the complexity of a separate `recurring_transaction_history` table. Instead, we track basic variance information directly in the `recurring_patterns` table. This approach:

- ‚úÖ **Covers 80% of use cases** with much simpler implementation
- ‚úÖ **Easier to maintain** and understand
- ‚úÖ **Still provides core functionality**: overdue detection, basic variance tracking, pattern adjustments
- ‚úÖ **Extensible**: Can add history table later if advanced analytics are needed

#### **Enhanced Transaction Table**
```sql
-- Add recurring fields to existing transactions table
ALTER TABLE transactions ADD COLUMN is_recurring BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
ALTER TABLE transactions ADD COLUMN recurring_pattern_id INTEGER REFERENCES recurring_patterns(id);
```

#### **New Recurring Patterns Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE recurring_patterns (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  tenant_id VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL REFERENCES tenants(id),
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, -- "Monthly Salary", "Quarterly Taxes"
  description TEXT,

  -- Pattern Definition
  frequency_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- 'weekly', 'bi-weekly', 'monthly', 'quarterly', 'semi-annually', 'annually', 'custom'
  frequency_value INTEGER DEFAULT 1, -- For custom frequencies (e.g., every 3 months = 3)
  frequency_unit VARCHAR(20), -- 'days', 'weeks', 'months', 'years' for custom frequencies

  -- Transaction Template
  account_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES accounts(id),
  category_id INTEGER REFERENCES categories(id),
  amount DECIMAL(12,2) NOT NULL,
  transaction_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- 'INCOME', 'EXPENSE', 'TRANSFER'
  description_template VARCHAR(255),

  -- Schedule Information
  start_date DATE NOT NULL,
  end_date DATE, -- NULL for indefinite
  next_expected_date DATE NOT NULL,
  last_generated_date DATE,

  -- Simple Variance Tracking
  last_variance_days INTEGER DEFAULT 0, -- Days variance from last occurrence
  last_variance_amount DECIMAL(12,2) DEFAULT 0.00, -- Amount variance from last occurrence
  consecutive_late_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0, -- Track consecutive late occurrences
  amount_variance_threshold DECIMAL(5,2) DEFAULT 10.00, -- Percentage threshold for amount alerts
  date_variance_threshold INTEGER DEFAULT 3, -- Days threshold for date alerts

  -- Status and Metadata
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  auto_generate BOOLEAN DEFAULT false, -- Whether to auto-create transactions
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

  INDEX idx_tenant_active (tenant_id, is_active),
  INDEX idx_next_expected (next_expected_date),
  INDEX idx_frequency (frequency_type)
);
```

## üí° **User Experience Flow**

### **Creating a Recurring Pattern**

2. Clicks "Make Recurring" on transaction or creates new pattern
3. Selects frequency (monthly, quarterly, etc.)
4. Sets start date and optional end date
5. Configures variance thresholds
6. Enables auto-generation if desired
7. Pattern is created and next expected date calculated

### **Managing Recurring Transactions**
1. User views recurring patterns dashboard
2. Sees upcoming transactions in calendar view
3. Reviews variance alerts and overdue items
4. Adjusts patterns based on changes
5. Views cash flow forecasts for planning

### **Variance Handling**
1. System detects variance when transaction is created (late/early or different amount)
2. Pattern variance fields are updated (last_variance_days, last_variance_amount, consecutive_late_count)
3. User receives notification if variance exceeds thresholds
4. User can adjust pattern expected date/amount based on recent variance
5. System suggests pattern adjustments for consistently late transactions

## üìã **Pre-Development Phase**

### **Day 0 - 2025-09-16**
**Focus**: Feature planning and documentation

**Planning Activities:**
- [x] Analyzed v4.1 Account Balance History UI implementation
- [x] Reviewed MVP Accounting System documentation for compliance requirements
- [x] Created comprehensive planning document with technical specifications
- [x] Defined data models and API structure
- [x] Established UI/UX requirements matching v4.1 design
- [x] Created README and execution log templates

**Key Decisions Made:**
- **MVP Accounting Compliance**: Strict adherence to balance calculation methods
- **UI Design**: Exact match to v4.1 proven design and layout
- **Chart Library**: Recharts for consistency with v4.1 implementation
- **Performance**: Optimize for 1-year date ranges with <2 second load times
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate reflection of transaction changes

**Dependencies Verified:**
- ‚úÖ Account Management System (available)
- ‚úÖ Transaction Management System (available)
- ‚úÖ MVP Accounting System (documented and implemented)
- ‚úÖ Date Utilities (available in v5)
- ‚è≥ Recharts Library (needs installation)

**Next Steps:**
- Install Recharts library
- Begin backend service implementation
- Create API endpoints following MVP accounting principles

## üîß **Technical Decisions**

### **MVP Accounting System Integration**
- **Decision**: Use `calculateAccountBalance()` method for all balance calculations
- **Rationale**: Ensures consistency with accounting system and supports balance anchors
- **Impact**: Accurate balance calculations with performance optimization

### **Chart Library Selection**
- **Decision**: Use Recharts library (same as v4.1)
- **Rationale**: Proven performance, good documentation, React-friendly
- **Impact**: Consistent chart behavior and easier maintenance

### **Data Calculation Strategy**
- **Decision**: Calculate balance history server-side
- **Rationale**: Better performance, consistent calculations, reduced client load
- **Impact**: Faster UI updates, more reliable data

### **UI Design Approach**
- **Decision**: Exact match to v4.1 design and layout
- **Rationale**: Proven user experience, consistent with user expectations
- **Impact**: Faster development, better user adoption

## 📋 **Pre-Development Phase**

### **Day 0 - 2025-09-16**
**Focus**: Feature planning and documentation

**Planning Activities:**
- [x] Analyzed v4.1 Account Balance History UI implementation
- [x] Reviewed MVP Accounting System documentation for compliance requirements
- [x] Created comprehensive planning document with technical specifications
- [x] Defined data models and API structure
- [x] Established UI/UX requirements matching v4.1 design
- [x] Created README and execution log templates

**Key Decisions Made:**
- **MVP Accounting Compliance**: Strict adherence to balance calculation methods
- **UI Design**: Exact match to v4.1 proven design and layout
- **Chart Library**: Recharts for consistency with v4.1 implementation
- **Performance**: Optimize for 1-year date ranges with <2 second load times
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate reflection of transaction changes

**Dependencies Verified:**
- ✅ Account Management System (available)
- ✅ Transaction Management System (available)
- ✅ MVP Accounting System (documented and implemented)
- ✅ Date Utilities (available in v5)
- ⏳ Recharts Library (needs installation)

**Next Steps:**
- Install Recharts library
- Begin backend service implementation
- Create API endpoints following MVP accounting principles

## 🚀 **Development Phase**

### **Day 1 - 2025-09-17**
**Focus**: Complete implementation with MVP accounting integration and perfect consistency

**Morning Accomplishments:**
- [x] ✅ Enhanced `AccountBalanceHistoryService` with anchor-based calculations
- [x] ✅ Implemented deterministic transaction sorting (date → ID → description)
- [x] ✅ Created `/api/accounts/[id]/transactions-with-balances` endpoint
- [x] ✅ Fixed running balance calculation with balance anchors as primary source
- [x] ✅ Updated unit tests for anchor-based calculation methods

**Afternoon Accomplishments:**
- [x] ✅ Fixed balance chart to use corrected transaction data
- [x] ✅ Fixed balance summary cards to derive from transaction data
- [x] ✅ Ensured perfect consistency between chart, table, and summary
- [x] ✅ Added anchor date display on account cards (Dashboard & Accounts List)
- [x] ✅ Created Dev Tools menu with API Test functionality

**Key Challenges Resolved:**
- **$30 Balance Discrepancy**: Fixed by ensuring final daily balances are used (not intermediate)
- **Non-deterministic Sorting**: Implemented date → ID → description sorting for same-date transactions
- **Data Inconsistency**: Unified all components to use single corrected data source
- **Authentication Issues**: Fixed token handling in Balance History page

**Major Achievement:**
Perfect consistency achieved across all Balance History components:
- Summary cards show correct balances (-$1,200)
- Chart displays accurate balance trend line
- Transactions table shows proper running balances
- All components use identical MVP accounting calculation logic

**Final Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Feature fully implemented and tested with perfect consistency across all components.

## 🔧 **Technical Decisions**

### **MVP Accounting System Integration**
- **Decision**: Use `calculateAccountBalance()` method for all balance calculations
- **Rationale**: Ensures consistency with accounting system and supports balance anchors
- **Impact**: Accurate balance calculations with performance optimization

### **Chart Library Selection**
- **Decision**: Use Recharts library (same as v4.1)
- **Rationale**: Proven performance, good documentation, React-friendly
- **Impact**: Consistent chart behavior and easier maintenance

### **Data Calculation Strategy**
- **Decision**: Calculate balance history server-side
- **Rationale**: Better performance, consistent calculations, reduced client load
- **Impact**: Faster UI updates, more reliable data

### **UI Design Approach**
- **Decision**: Exact match to v4.1 design and layout
- **Rationale**: Proven user experience, consistent with user expectations
- **Impact**: Faster development, better user adoption

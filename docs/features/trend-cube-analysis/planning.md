# Feature: Trend Cube Analysis

**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Estimated Start**: 2025-09-19
**Priority**: High

---

## üéØ **Goal**
Create a powerful financial trend analysis tool that leverages the financial cube for fast, flexible drill-down analysis. This solves the problem of users not being able to easily identify spending patterns, trends, and specific merchants driving their expenses across different time periods and categories.

## üë• **User Impact**
Users can perform sophisticated financial analysis with 3-level drill-down capabilities:
1. **High-level trends** (Category/Account summaries)
2. **Pattern analysis** (Recurring vs one-time breakdowns)
3. **Merchant insights** (Individual transaction descriptions)

This enables users to discover spending patterns, optimize budgets, identify fraud, and make data-driven financial decisions.

**User Story**: As a FinTrack user, I want to analyze my spending trends with flexible grouping and drill-down capabilities so that I can identify specific merchants and patterns driving my expenses and make informed budget decisions.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Approach**

### **Database Changes**
- [ ] No new tables required - leverages existing financial_cube
- [ ] Potential index optimization on financial_cube for common query patterns
- [ ] Migration required: No (uses existing cube structure)

### **Merchant Enhancement Database Changes**
- [ ] **Add merchant field**: `ALTER TABLE transactions ADD COLUMN merchant VARCHAR(255)`
- [ ] **Add to financial cube**: `ALTER TABLE financial_cube ADD COLUMN merchant_name VARCHAR(255)`
- [ ] **Migration script**: Parse existing transaction descriptions to populate merchant field
- [ ] **Index optimization**: Add index on `transactions.merchant` for fast aggregation queries

### **API Endpoints Needed**
- [ ] `GET /api/trends/cube-summary` - Get aggregated data from financial cube (Levels 1 & 2)
- [ ] `GET /api/trends/transaction-details` - Get transaction details for drill-down (Level 3)
- [ ] `GET /api/trends/merchant-groups` - Get normalized merchant groupings
- [ ] `GET /api/trends/insights` - Get auto-generated insights (future)

### **UI Components**
- [ ] `TrendAnalysisPage` - Main page container with filters and results
- [ ] `TrendFiltersPanel` - Required and optional filter controls
- [ ] `TrendResultsTable` - Expandable table with drill-down capabilities
- [ ] `TrendTableRow` - Individual row with expand/collapse functionality
- [ ] `TrendExportButton` - Export functionality for current view
- [ ] `InsightsPanel` - Auto-generated insights display (future)

### **Third-party Integrations**
- None required for core functionality
- Potential: OpenAI/Claude API for auto-insights generation (future enhancement)

## üìù **Notes & Decisions**

### **Technical Decisions**
- [Decision 1]: [Rationale]
- [Decision 2]: [Rationale]

### **Open Questions**
- **Auto-Insights Implementation**: Should we use rule-based detection or AI-powered analysis for generating insights?
- **Merchant Grouping Strategy**: Client-side normalization vs server-side preprocessing vs hybrid approach?
- **Performance Optimization**: Should we cache cube queries or implement real-time aggregation?

### **Merchant Enhancement Decisions**
- **Merchant Field Approach**: ‚úÖ **DECIDED** - Add internal-only merchant field to transactions table
- **Parsing Strategy**: Auto-parse descriptions during transaction creation/import, not exposed to users initially
- **Tooltip Implementation**: Hover over amount cells in trends table to show merchant breakdown
- **Data Flow**: Transaction description ‚Üí parsed merchant ‚Üí financial cube ‚Üí trends aggregation ‚Üí tooltip display
- **Performance**: Pre-parsed merchants enable fast tooltip queries without real-time description parsing

### **Auto-Generated Insights Concept**

**Vision**: Automatically analyze cube data + merchant patterns to generate personalized financial insights and alerts based on user preferences.

**Potential Insights**:
- **Spending Spikes**: "Your Food & Dining spending increased 40% this month ($450 vs $320 average)"
- **New Merchants**: "You spent $89 at 3 new restaurants this month"
- **Recurring Changes**: "Your Netflix subscription increased from $15.99 to $17.99"
- **Budget Variance**: "You're 85% through your Entertainment budget with 10 days left in the month"
- **Seasonal Patterns**: "Your utility bills are typically 25% higher in winter months"
- **Optimization Opportunities**: "You could save $45/month by consolidating your 3 streaming subscriptions"

**Implementation Approaches**:
1. **Rule-Based Detection** (Phase 1): Predefined rules for common patterns
2. **Statistical Analysis** (Phase 2): Variance detection, trend analysis, outlier identification
3. **AI-Powered Insights** (Phase 3): LLM analysis of spending patterns with personalized recommendations

**User Preference Controls**:
- Insight frequency (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Insight types (spending alerts, optimization tips, trend notifications)
- Threshold sensitivity (only major changes vs all changes)
- Delivery method (in-app, email, push notifications)

### **Assumptions**
- [Assumption 1]: [Impact if wrong]
- [Assumption 2]: [Impact if wrong]

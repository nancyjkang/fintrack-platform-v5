# Feature: Transaction CRUD

**Created**: 2025-01-15
**Estimated Start**: 2025-01-15
**Priority**: High

---

## üéØ **Goal**
Implement complete transaction management functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with both API endpoints and UI components. This is the foundation feature that enables users to manage their financial transactions and unblocks all other transaction-dependent features.

## üë• **User Impact**
Users can create, view, edit, and delete their financial transactions. This enables core personal finance tracking functionality and provides the data foundation for all reporting and analytics features.

**User Story**: As a FinTrack user, I want to manage my financial transactions (income, expenses, transfers) so that I can track my money flow and build accurate financial reports.

## üìä **Scope Definition**

### **‚úÖ Must Have (Core Functionality)**
- [ ] **Transaction API Endpoints** - Full CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- [ ] **Transaction List UI** - View transactions with basic filtering (based on v4 layout)
- [ ] **Add Transaction Form** - Create new transactions with validation
- [ ] **Edit Transaction** - Update existing transactions
- [ ] **Delete Transaction** - Remove transactions with confirmation
- [ ] **Transaction Types** - Support INCOME, EXPENSE, TRANSFER types
- [ ] **Recurring Transactions** - Mark transactions as recurring with basic recurrence info
- [ ] **Account Integration** - Link transactions to accounts
- [ ] **Basic Validation** - Required fields, amount validation, date validation

### **‚ö° Should Have (Important)**
- [ ] **Pagination** - Handle large transaction lists efficiently
- [ ] **Basic Filtering** - Filter by account, date range, type, recurring status
- [ ] **Search Functionality** - Search transactions by description
- [ ] **Recurring Indicators** - Visual indicators for recurring transactions in list
- [ ] **Loading States** - Proper loading indicators during API calls
- [ ] **Error Handling** - User-friendly error messages

### **üí° Nice to Have (If Time Permits)**
- [ ] **Bulk Operations** - Select and delete multiple transactions
- [ ] **Transaction Categories** - Basic category assignment
- [ ] **Sorting Options** - Sort by date, amount, description
- [ ] **Mobile Responsiveness** - Optimized mobile transaction management

### **‚ùå Out of Scope (For This Version)**
- Advanced filtering and search (separate feature)
- CSV import/export (separate feature)
- Automatic recurring transaction generation (separate feature)
- Transaction rules and auto-categorization (separate feature)
- Advanced bulk operations (separate feature)

---

## üîó **Dependencies**

### **Prerequisites (Must be done first)**
- [x] **Authentication System** - Required for user context and tenant isolation
- [x] **Account APIs** - Transactions must be linked to accounts
- [x] **Database Schema** - Transaction table exists in Prisma schema
- [ ] **Multi-tenant Support** - Ensure transactions are tenant-scoped

### **Dependent Features (Blocked by this)**
- **Account Management UI** - Needs transaction data for account balances
- **Category Management** - Transactions need to be categorizable
- **CSV Import System** - Imports create transactions via API
- **Transaction Filtering** - Advanced filtering depends on basic CRUD
- **Bulk Transaction Operations** - Bulk operations depend on individual CRUD
- **Recurring Transaction Automation** - Auto-generation depends on recurring flag
- **Dashboard Analytics** - All reporting depends on transaction data

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Approach**

### **Database Changes**
- [x] **Transaction table exists** - Already defined in Prisma schema
- [ ] **Verify schema** - Ensure all required fields are present
- [ ] **Migration required**: No (schema already exists)

### **API Endpoints Needed**
- [ ] `GET /api/transactions` - List transactions with filtering and pagination
- [ ] `POST /api/transactions` - Create new transaction
- [ ] `GET /api/transactions/[id]` - Get single transaction details
- [ ] `PUT /api/transactions/[id]` - Update existing transaction
- [ ] `DELETE /api/transactions/[id]` - Delete transaction

### **UI Components**
- [ ] **TransactionsList** - Main transaction list component (based on v4 TransactionsTable)
- [ ] **TransactionForm** - Add/edit transaction form modal with recurring options
- [ ] **TransactionRow** - Individual transaction display component with recurring indicator
- [ ] **DeleteConfirmDialog** - Confirmation dialog for deletion
- [ ] **TransactionFilters** - Basic filtering controls including recurring filter
- [ ] **TransactionSearch** - Search input component
- [ ] **RecurringIndicator** - Visual component to show recurring status

### **Third-party Integrations**
- **Prisma ORM** - Database operations and type safety
- **Zod** - API request/response validation
- **React Hook Form** - Form handling and validation
- **Lucide React** - Icons for UI components

## ‚è±Ô∏è **Estimates**

### **Complexity Assessment**
- **Overall Complexity**: Medium
- **Database Work**: 2 hours - Schema verification and minor adjustments
- **API Development**: 18 hours - 5 endpoints with validation, error handling, pagination, recurring support
- **UI Development**: 24 hours - 7 components following v4 layout patterns, recurring UI elements
- **Testing & Polish**: 8 hours - Manual testing, error handling, loading states, recurring scenarios

### **Time Estimate**
- **Total Estimate**: 4.25 days (34 hours)
- **Buffer (20%)**: 0.85 days (6.8 hours)
- **Final Estimate**: 5.1 days ‚Üí **5 days** (updated from 4 days due to recurring functionality)

### **Risk Assessment**
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Main Risks**:
  - **Complex v4 UI patterns**: May take longer to adapt v4 TransactionsTable complexity to v5 - Mitigation: Start with simpler version, iterate
  - **Multi-tenant data isolation**: Ensuring proper tenant scoping in all operations - Mitigation: Follow existing account API patterns
  - **Performance with large datasets**: Transaction lists can be large - Mitigation: Implement pagination from start

## 🧪 **QA Test Cases**

### **Test Case 1: Pagination Functionality**

**Objective**: Verify pagination works correctly with large datasets

**Prerequisites**:
- User account with 100+ transactions
- Access to `/transactions` page

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to `/transactions` page
2. Verify transactions are displayed (should show up to 100 per page)
3. Check pagination controls appear at bottom if more than 100 transactions exist
4. Click "Next" button to go to page 2
5. Verify different transactions are shown
6. Click "Previous" button to return to page 1
7. Click specific page numbers (if available)
8. Verify "Showing X to Y of Z transactions" display is accurate

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Pagination controls only appear when needed (>100 transactions)
- ✅ Page navigation works smoothly without errors
- ✅ Transaction count display is accurate
- ✅ No duplicate transactions across pages
- ✅ Performance remains fast (<2 seconds per page load)

**Test Data**: Import CSV with 200+ transactions to test multiple pages

### **Test Case 2: Column Sorting - Basic Functionality**

**Objective**: Verify all column headers are sortable and work correctly

**Prerequisites**:
- User account with diverse transaction data (different dates, amounts, descriptions, etc.)
- Access to `/transactions` page

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to `/transactions` page
2. Click on "Date" column header
3. Verify transactions are sorted by date (ascending)
4. Click "Date" header again
5. Verify transactions are sorted by date (descending)
6. Repeat steps 2-5 for each sortable column:
   - Description (alphabetical)
   - Amount (numerical)
   - Type (INCOME/EXPENSE/TRANSFER)
   - Category (alphabetical by category name)
   - Account (alphabetical by account name)

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ All column headers are clickable and show hover effects
- ✅ First click sorts ascending, second click sorts descending
- ✅ Visual indicators (arrows) show current sort direction
- ✅ Only one column can be actively sorted at a time
- ✅ Sorting works across entire dataset, not just current page

---

### **Test Case 3: Server-Side Sorting Verification**

**Objective**: Confirm sorting works on entire dataset, not just current page

**Prerequisites**:
- User account with 150+ transactions
- Transactions with varied amounts (some very high, some very low)

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to `/transactions` page
2. Click "Amount" column header to sort descending
3. Verify the highest amount transaction appears first on page 1
4. Navigate to page 2 (if available)
5. Verify amounts on page 2 are lower than the lowest amount on page 1
6. Switch to "Amount" ascending sort
7. Verify the lowest amount (or most negative) appears first
8. Check subsequent pages maintain proper sort order

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Highest amounts appear first when sorting descending (across all pages)
- ✅ Lowest amounts appear first when sorting ascending (across all pages)
- ✅ Sort order is maintained across page navigation
- ✅ No inconsistencies in sort order between pages

---

### **Test Case 4: Sorting with Filtering**

**Objective**: Verify sorting works correctly when filters are applied

**Prerequisites**:
- User account with transactions across multiple accounts and categories
- Access to `/transactions` page

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to `/transactions` page
2. Apply a filter (e.g., select specific account)
3. Click "Date" column to sort
4. Verify only filtered transactions are sorted
5. Change sort to "Description" 
6. Verify filtered results remain properly sorted
7. Clear filter
8. Verify sort is maintained for full dataset
9. Apply different filter (e.g., date range)
10. Verify sorting still works with new filter

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Sorting only affects filtered results when filters are active
- ✅ Sort state is preserved when filters change
- ✅ Clearing filters maintains current sort order
- ✅ Performance remains good with combined filtering and sorting

---

### **Test Case 5: Pagination State Management**

**Objective**: Verify pagination resets appropriately when filters change

**Prerequisites**:
- User account with 200+ transactions
- Multiple accounts and date ranges available

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to `/transactions` page
2. Go to page 3 (if available)
3. Apply a filter that reduces results to <100 transactions
4. Verify pagination controls disappear or adjust appropriately
5. Clear filter
6. Verify user returns to page 1 (not page 3)
7. Apply different filter
8. Verify pagination resets to page 1

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Pagination resets to page 1 when filters change
- ✅ Pagination controls hide when results fit on one page
- ✅ Page numbers adjust correctly based on filtered results
- ✅ No broken pagination states

---

### **Test Case 6: Performance Testing**

**Objective**: Verify performance remains acceptable with large datasets

**Prerequisites**:
- User account with 500+ transactions (use CSV import if needed)
- Browser developer tools for performance monitoring

**Test Steps**:
1. Open browser developer tools (Network tab)
2. Navigate to `/transactions` page
3. Measure initial load time
4. Click different column headers to sort
5. Measure sort response time
6. Navigate between pages
7. Measure pagination response time
8. Apply filters and sort
9. Measure combined operation time

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Initial page load: <2 seconds
- ✅ Sort operations: <1 second
- ✅ Page navigation: <1 second
- ✅ No memory leaks or performance degradation
- ✅ Smooth user experience throughout

---

### **Test Case 7: Mobile Responsiveness**

**Objective**: Verify pagination and sorting work on mobile devices

**Prerequisites**:
- Mobile device or browser developer tools mobile simulation
- User account with 100+ transactions

**Test Steps**:
1. Open `/transactions` page on mobile device
2. Verify pagination controls are usable on small screen
3. Test column header tapping for sorting
4. Verify sort indicators are visible
5. Test page navigation on mobile
6. Check horizontal scrolling if needed for table

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Pagination controls are touch-friendly
- ✅ Column headers are tappable and responsive
- ✅ Sort indicators are clearly visible
- ✅ Table scrolls horizontally if needed
- ✅ No UI elements are cut off or unusable

---

### **Test Case 8: Edge Cases**

**Objective**: Test edge cases and error scenarios

**Test Steps**:
1. **Empty Results**: Apply filters that return no transactions, verify pagination handles gracefully
2. **Single Page**: With exactly 100 transactions, verify pagination controls behave correctly
3. **Network Issues**: Test sorting/pagination with slow network (throttle in dev tools)
4. **Rapid Clicking**: Click sort headers rapidly, verify no race conditions
5. **Browser Back/Forward**: Navigate away and back, verify state is preserved appropriately

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Graceful handling of edge cases
- ✅ No JavaScript errors in console
- ✅ Appropriate loading states during network delays
- ✅ No broken UI states

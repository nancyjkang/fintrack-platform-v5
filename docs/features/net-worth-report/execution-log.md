## üßÆ Calculation Validation

### **Net Worth Calculation**
- [ ] **Formula**: Sum(Assets) - Sum(Liabilities) = Net Worth
- [ ] **Balance Anchor Integration**: Use most recent anchor + subsequent transactions
- [ ] **Account Classification**: ASSET (+), LIABILITY (-), EXCLUDED (ignored)
- [ ] **Date Accuracy**: Calculations reflect exact date boundaries
- [ ] **Multi-Account Support**: Handle selected account subsets

### **Rate of Return Calculation**
- [ ] **Absolute Change**: End Value - Start Value
- [ ] **Percentage Change**: (End Value - Start Value) / Start Value √ó 100
- [ ] **Annualized Return**: Account for time period length
- [ ] **CAGR**: Compound Annual Growth Rate for multi-year periods
- [ ] **Period Validation**: Ensure start date < end date

### **Asset/Liability Breakdown**
- [ ] **Asset Totals**: Sum all ASSET account balances (positive values)
- [ ] **Liability Totals**: Sum all LIABILITY account balances (absolute values)
- [ ] **Percentage Calculations**: Individual account / total √ó 100
- [ ] **Growth Calculations**: (Current - Start) / Start √ó 100
- [ ] **Interest Rate Integration**: Pull from account metadata

## üß™ Testing Progress

### **Unit Tests**
- [ ] Time period date calculation accuracy
- [ ] Net worth calculation with balance anchors
- [ ] Rate of return formula validation
- [ ] Asset/liability classification logic
- [ ] Account filtering and selection

### **Integration Tests**
- [ ] End-to-end report generation
- [ ] Balance anchor data integration
- [ ] Multi-account calculations
- [ ] Period comparison accuracy
- [ ] Chart data transformation

### **User Interface Tests**
- [ ] Period selector functionality
- [ ] Account selector multi-select
- [ ] Chart interactivity and tooltips
- [ ] Table sorting and filtering
- [ ] Export functionality
- [ ] Responsive design validation

### **Performance Tests**
- [ ] Large dataset handling (1000+ accounts)
- [ ] Historical data processing speed
- [ ] Chart rendering performance
- [ ] Export generation time
- [ ] Memory usage optimization

## üé® UI/UX Validation

### **Layout Compliance**
- [ ] Summary cards display key metrics prominently
- [ ] Net worth chart shows clear trend line
- [ ] Assets vs liabilities chart uses distinct colors
- [ ] Asset breakdown: pie chart + growth table side by side
- [ ] Liability breakdown: pie chart + details table side by side
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile devices

### **Color Scheme Validation**
- [ ] Net Worth Positive: #4CAF50 (Green) ‚úÖ
- [ ] Net Worth Negative: #F44336 (Red) ‚úÖ
- [ ] Assets: #2196F3 (Blue) ‚úÖ
- [ ] Liabilities: #FF9800 (Orange) ‚úÖ
- [ ] Background: #FAFAFA (Light Gray) ‚úÖ

- [ ] Account selector filters all components

## üìä Data Accuracy Validation

### **Balance Anchor Integration**
- [ ] Most recent anchor used as baseline
- [ ] Transactions after anchor date included
- [ ] Historical calculations use appropriate anchors
- [ ] Account balance matches anchor + transactions

### **Time Period Accuracy**
- [ ] This Month: Correct start (1st) and end (today)
- [ ] Last Month: Full previous month boundaries
- [ ] Quarter calculations: Q1 (Jan-Mar), Q2 (Apr-Jun), Q3 (Jul-Sep), Q4 (Oct-Dec)
- [ ] Half-year calculations: H1 (Jan-Jun), H2 (Jul-Dec)
- [ ] Year calculations: Jan 1 to Dec 31
- [ ] Custom range: User-selected dates respected

### **Account Classification**
- [ ] ASSET accounts contribute positively to net worth
- [ ] LIABILITY accounts contribute negatively to net worth
- [ ] EXCLUDED accounts ignored in calculations
- [ ] Account type filtering works correctly

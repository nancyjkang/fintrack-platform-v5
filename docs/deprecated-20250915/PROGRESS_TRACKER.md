> **👉 Use Instead:**
> - **[FEATURE_BACKLOG.md](./FEATURE_BACKLOG.md)** - Prioritized feature list with status tracking
> - **[WEEKLY_PLANNING.md](./WEEKLY_PLANNING.md)** - Current sprint focus and weekly planning
> - **[DAILY_EXECUTION.md](./DAILY_EXECUTION.md)** - Daily progress tracking and execution
> - **Feature-specific progress** - Individual `docs/features/[feature-name]/execution-log.md` files
>

## 📋 **Why This Was Deprecated**

This document was replaced because:

1. **Feature status tracking** is better managed in `FEATURE_BACKLOG.md`
2. **Weekly planning** is better managed in `WEEKLY_PLANNING.md`
3. **Daily progress** is better managed in `DAILY_EXECUTION.md`
4. **Feature-specific progress** is better tracked in individual feature execution logs

The new system provides:
- ✅ **Less duplication** - Each piece of information has one authoritative source
- ✅ **Better organization** - Feature-focused rather than time-focused
- ✅ **Easier maintenance** - Fewer documents to keep updated
- ✅ **More actionable** - Direct connection to feature specifications and planning

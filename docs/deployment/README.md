# Deployment Documentation

This directory contains all deployment-related documentation including CI/CD workflows and database deployment strategies.

## 🚀 Deployment Guides

### **[CI/CD Pipeline Documentation](../features/ci-cd-pipeline/)**
**Complete CI/CD pipeline documentation** *(Updated Location)*
- **[Implementation Guide](../features/ci-cd-pipeline/implementation.md)** - Complete setup + best practices
- **[Execution Log](../features/ci-cd-pipeline/execution-log.md)** - Real-world deployment experience
- **[Planning Document](../features/ci-cd-pipeline/planning.md)** - Original requirements

*Note: Old `CI_CD_WORKFLOW.md` has been [deprecated](./CI_CD_WORKFLOW_DEPRECATED.md) and consolidated.*

### **[DATABASE_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](./DATABASE_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)**
**Database deployment strategies and best practices**
- Migration strategies (safe vs. destructive)
- Environment-specific deployment procedures
- Backup and rollback procedures
- Data integrity validation

## 🔄 Deployment Flow

```
Local Development → GitHub → CI/CD Pipeline → Staging → Production
```

### **Development to Staging**
1. **Code Changes** → Local development and testing
2. **Git Hooks** → Pre-commit checks (TypeScript, tests, build)
3. **Push to GitHub** → Pre-push hooks (security audit, final validation)
4. **GitHub Actions** → Automated CI/CD pipeline
5. **Vercel Deployment** → Automatic deployment to staging

### **Staging to Production** (Future)
1. **Staging Testing** → Manual QA and validation
2. **Production Deploy** → Careful deployment with monitoring
3. **Health Checks** → Automated verification
4. **Rollback Plan** → Ready if issues arise

## 🛠️ Available Scripts

### **Pre-deployment**
- `npm run pre-deploy` - Complete pre-deployment checks
- `npm run ci-check` - Run all CI checks locally
- `npm run backup-data` - Backup current data

### **Deployment**
- `npm run deploy` - Deploy to staging
- `npm run deploy:preview` - Deploy preview branch
- `npm run deploy:force` - Force deploy (bypass checks)

### **Post-deployment**
- `npm run deploy-check` - Verify deployment health
- `npm run rollback` - Rollback to previous version

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- **Environment Variables** - Secure secret management
- **Database Access** - Encrypted connections and restricted access
- **API Security** - Rate limiting and authentication
- **Monitoring** - Real-time security monitoring

## 📊 Monitoring and Health Checks

- **Health Endpoint** - `/api/health` for basic application health
- **Database Connectivity** - Automatic connection validation
- **Performance Monitoring** - Vercel Analytics integration
- **Error Tracking** - Planned Sentry integration

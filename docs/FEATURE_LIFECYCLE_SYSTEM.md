## 💡 **Documentation Best Practices**

### **Keep It Current:**
- **Link Everything**: When you update one doc, check if others need updates
- **Use Templates**: Follow established patterns for consistency
- **Be Specific**: Include exact API contracts and implementation details

### **Avoid Duplication:**
- **Single Source of Truth**: Each piece of information should live in one place
- **Cross-Reference**: Link between docs rather than copying content
- **Deprecate Outdated**: Remove or deprecate docs that are no longer relevant

### **Make It Actionable:**
- **Include Examples**: Show how to use APIs and components
- **Provide Commands**: Include exact commands and scripts to run
- **Think Recreation**: Write specs so someone else could rebuild the feature

---

This system ensures every feature goes through the same rigorous process while keeping documentation lightweight and actionable. Each phase has clear deliverables and success criteria, making it easy to track progress and maintain quality.

**The key**: `DAILY_EXECUTION.md` and `FEATURE_BACKLOG.md` are your daily anchors - everything else flows from these core documents.

*Use this template for every feature to ensure consistent quality and documentation.*

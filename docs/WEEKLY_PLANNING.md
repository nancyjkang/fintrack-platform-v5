### **üí° Nice to Have (If Time Permits)**

#### **5. Additional Feature Documentation**
- [ ] Document any other implemented features discovered during review
- [ ] Create specifications for utility systems (error handling, validation)

---

---

## ‚úÖ **Success Criteria**

### **By End of Week, We Should Have:**

#### **Documentation Completeness**
- [ ] **4+ Features Fully Documented**: Account Management, Dashboard, Navigation, Health Check
- [ ] **Complete Specifications**: Each feature has planning.md and implementation.md
- [ ] **Updated Backlog**: FEATURE_BACKLOG.md reflects all documented features
- [ ] **Rebuild Capability**: Documented features can be recreated from specs

#### **Development Progress**
- [ ] **Transaction CRUD Planned**: Complete specification ready for implementation
- [ ] **First API Endpoint**: POST /api/transactions implemented and tested
- [ ] **Feature Branch**: transaction-crud feature branch created and active

#### **System Integration**
- [ ] **Documentation Links**: All features linked in FEATURE_BACKLOG.md
- [ ] **Progress Tracking**: PROGRESS_TRACKER.md updated with weekly progress
- [ ] **Quality Standards**: All documentation follows established patterns

## üöß **Potential Blockers & Mitigation**

### **Known Risks:**
- **Feature Complexity**: Some features may be more complex than expected to document
- **Missing Context**: May need to reverse-engineer some implementation details
- **Time Estimation**: Documentation might take longer than planned

### **Mitigation Plans:**
- **If Documentation is Complex**: Focus on core functionality first, add details iteratively
- **If Context is Missing**: Use code analysis and testing to understand behavior
- **If Time is Short**: Prioritize Account Management and Dashboard (highest impact)

---

## üìä **Next Week Preview**

### **Week of January 27-31, 2025**

**Likely Focus**: Transaction CRUD Implementation + Additional Feature Documentation

#### **Probable Priorities:**
1. **Complete Transaction CRUD**: Finish all API endpoints and basic UI
2. **Document More Features**: Continue documenting remaining implemented features
3. **Begin Account Balance System**: Start implementing balance calculations
4. **CSV Import Planning**: Begin planning CSV import feature

**Dependencies**: This week's documentation foundation being completed

---

## üìà **Feature Documentation Pipeline**

### **Current Status:**
- **‚úÖ Documented**: Authentication System, Multi-Tenant Support
- **üîÑ This Week**: Account Management, Dashboard, Navigation, Health Check
- **üìã Next Week**: Transaction CRUD, CSV Import, Category Management
- **üîÆ Future**: Reporting, Goals, Advanced Features

### **Documentation Quality Standards:**
Each feature must have:
- [ ] **Complete Planning**: Detailed specification for recreation
- [ ] **Implementation Details**: Technical documentation of what was built
- [ ] **API Contracts**: Exact endpoint specifications with examples
- [ ] **UI Specifications**: Component structure and behavior
- [ ] **Testing Strategy**: How to verify the feature works

---

## üìù **Sprint Notes & Decisions**

### **Feature Documentation Strategy:**
- **Prioritize Core Features**: Focus on features users interact with most
- **Quality over Quantity**: Better to have fewer, complete specifications
- **Iterative Improvement**: Can enhance documentation over time

### **Development Approach:**
- **Documentation First**: Complete specs before major new development
- **Feature-Based Planning**: Organize work around complete features
- **Continuous Integration**: Update documentation as features evolve

### **Technical Standards:**
- **API Documentation**: Include request/response examples
- **UI Documentation**: Include component props and behavior
- **Testing Documentation**: Include test scenarios and validation

---

## üîÑ **Weekly Review Process**

### **End of Week Checklist:**
- [ ] **Review FEATURE_BACKLOG.md**: Update feature statuses and priorities
- [ ] **Plan Next Week**: Identify next sprint's feature priorities in this document
- [ ] **Document Lessons**: Note what worked well and what to improve
- [ ] **Update Feature Docs**: Ensure all completed features have updated documentation

### **Sprint Retrospective Questions:**
1. **What features were successfully documented this week?**
2. **What blockers or challenges did we encounter?**
3. **How can we improve the documentation process?**
4. **What should be the next week's top priorities?**

---

*This weekly planning integrates with the FinTrack v5 feature lifecycle system to ensure systematic progress toward complete feature documentation and reliable rebuild capability.*

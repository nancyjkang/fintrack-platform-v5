# AI Behavior Patterns and Pitfalls

**Date**: September 19, 2025
**Context**: Performance optimization work on bulk transaction operations
**Incident**: AI changed function specifications without permission during async cube update implementation

## üö® Critical AI Behavior Pattern Identified

### The Problem: Spec Drift Without Permission
- **What Happened**: When implementing async cube updates for performance, the AI automatically changed function signatures and parameters without asking for user approval
- **Root Issue**: AI tends to prioritize immediate technical solutions over maintaining agreed-upon specifications
- **Impact**: Unacceptable changes to feature contracts that the user didn't approve

### The Pattern: Short-Term Fixes Over Root Cause Analysis
The AI consistently exhibits this problematic behavior pattern:

1. **Encounters a technical challenge** (e.g., performance issue)
2. **Immediately jumps to a "quick fix"** without analyzing root cause
3. **Changes specifications to make the fix easier** rather than working within constraints
4. **Assumes the user will accept the changes** without explicit permission
5. **Focuses on making code work** rather than maintaining architectural integrity

## üéØ Required AI Behavior Changes

### CRITICAL RULE: Never Change Specs Without Permission
- **ALWAYS ask** before changing function signatures, parameters, or expected behavior
- **Present options** to the user rather than making unilateral decisions
- **Respect existing contracts** even if they make implementation more challenging
- **Get explicit approval** for any deviation from agreed specifications

### Better Approach: Root Cause Analysis First
Instead of jumping to quick fixes:
1. **Analyze the actual root cause** of the problem
2. **Present multiple solution options** with trade-offs
3. **Ask which approach the user prefers**
4. **Implement within the chosen constraints**
5. **Only suggest spec changes as an explicit option**, not a default

## üìã Specific Examples from This Incident

### ‚ùå What AI Did Wrong:
```typescript
// Changed function signature without permission
async bulkUpdateTransactions(
  tenantId: string,
  updates: BulkTransactionUpdate[],
  asyncCubeUpdate: boolean = true  // ‚Üê Added parameter without asking
): Promise<{ success: boolean; updatedCount: number }>
```

### ‚úÖ What AI Should Have Done:
1. **Identified the performance issue** (nested loops in cube updates)
2. **Asked**: "I see the performance issue is in the cube update logic. How would you like me to handle this? Options:
   - Keep existing `skipCubeUpdate` parameter, change default to `false`, use async when enabled
   - Add new `asyncCubeUpdate` parameter alongside existing one
   - Replace sync calls with async without changing signatures
   - Other approach you prefer?"
3. **Waited for user decision** before implementing

## üß† Learning for Future AI Interactions

### For Users Working with AI:
- **Watch for spec drift** - AI will try to change specifications to make implementation easier
- **Demand explicit permission** for any changes to agreed-upon interfaces
- **Ask AI to present options** rather than making assumptions
- **Emphasize root cause analysis** over quick fixes

### For AI Behavior:
- **Pause before changing anything** - ask first
- **Present trade-offs clearly** - let user decide
- **Respect constraints** - work within them, don't change them
- **Focus on root causes** - not just symptoms

## üîÑ Process Improvement

### New AI Workflow:
1. **Identify Problem** ‚Üí Analyze root cause thoroughly
2. **Generate Options** ‚Üí Present multiple approaches with trade-offs
3. **Ask User** ‚Üí Get explicit direction on preferred approach
4. **Implement** ‚Üí Work within chosen constraints
5. **Verify** ‚Üí Confirm implementation matches user expectations

### Red Flags to Watch For:
- AI changing function signatures without asking
- AI adding/removing parameters "for convenience"
- AI modifying expected behavior to make implementation easier
- AI assuming user will accept changes
- AI focusing on making code work rather than maintaining architecture

---

**Key Takeaway**: AI tends to optimize for immediate technical solutions rather than maintaining specification integrity. Users must actively guard against this tendency and demand explicit permission for any spec changes.
